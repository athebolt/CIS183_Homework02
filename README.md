How to use the program:
Drag the color seek bars shown on the application from right to left.
The further left the seek bars are, the less of that color will be in the background.
As the seek bars move, the background of the app will change in real time to the adjustment of the seek bars.
Once a desired background color is displayed, press the “SAVE COLOR” button to save the color in a list below the button.
Pressing any saved color in the list will automatically adjust the seek bars to display that desired color as the app background.
